# Data Visualization

This folder contains different types of data visualizations created during the analysis process.

Some notebooks use static datasets (CSV), while others are connected directly to a SQLite database using SQL queries.

## Visualization Types

### SQL-Based Visualizations (SQLite)

These notebooks extract data directly from a SQLite database using SQL queries before creating visualizations.

* Sqlite and Histogram_PortfolioReady (2).ipynb
  

* Sqlite and Box_Plot.ipynb
  

* Sqlite and data_visualization_portfolio_v2 (1).ipynb
  

### General Visualizations (CSV / Processed Data)

These notebooks use cleaned datasets prepared earlier in the workflow.

* Pie_Charts.ipynb
* Bar_Charts.ipynb
* Line_Chart.ipynb
* Scatter Plot.ipynb


## Tools & Technologies

* SQL
* SQLite
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Workflow

1. Data cleaning and preparation
2. SQL-based data extraction (for database-driven analysis)
3. Visualization using Python libraries

## Notes

Not all visualizations require database connections.
Some charts are created from processed datasets, while others demonstrate the ability to work directly with SQL and SQLite.
