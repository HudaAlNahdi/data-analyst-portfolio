# End-to-End Data Analyst Project

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow from raw data collection to insights and presentation.

It reflects a real-world data analyst pipeline using Python, SQL, and visualization tools.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to collect, explore, clean, analyze, and visualize developer-related data to uncover meaningful patterns and insights.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following stages:

### 1. Data Acquisition

* Data collected using APIs
* Data gathered through web scraping
* Raw datasets prepared for analysis

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Understanding dataset structure
* Identifying missing values
* Exploring distributions
* Correlation analysis between variables

### 3. Data Wrangling

* Data cleaning and transformation
* Handling missing values and inconsistencies
* Preparing structured datasets

### 4. SQL & Database Analysis

* Extracting data using SQL queries
* Working with SQLite database
* Building analysis-ready datasets

### 5. Data Visualization
