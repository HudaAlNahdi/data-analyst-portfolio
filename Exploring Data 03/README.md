# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This section focuses on exploring the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and initial patterns before data cleaning, SQL analysis, and visualization.

## Objective

* Understand dataset structure
* Explore variables and data types
* Identify missing values
* Examine distributions and basic statistics
* Analyze relationships between variables using correlation


## Key Exploration Steps

1. Inspect dataset shape and columns
2. Review data types
3. Analyze missing values
4. Generate summary statistics
5. Explore distributions of key variables
6. Correlation analysis between numerical features

## Tools Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Purpose in the Project Workflow

EDA helps define the direction of the analysis and highlights:

* important variables
* data quality issues
* relationships between features
* areas requiring cleaning or transformation

The insights from this stage informed the next steps of the project:

data cleaning → SQL analysis → visualization → insights
